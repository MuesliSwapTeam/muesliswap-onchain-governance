"""
The staking contract.

This contract holds governance tokens (i.e. MILK) and vault FT tokens that represent
locked governance tokens. It tracks participation in tallies and releases these tokens
only when they are not participating in a tally anymore.

This contract is intended to be have inputs from these contracts:
- staking/staking (1 at most, maintaining the state of participations)
- tally/tally: For tracking the retraction of participation in a tally

This contract is intended to have mints with these contracts:
- staking/staking_vote_nft: For tracking the addition of participation in a tally

Outputs of this contract may go to:
- staking/staking (1 at most, continuation of the above)
- the owner of the staking position (for withdrawing funds)
- tally/tally (1 at most, maintaining the tally state, no value transfer should happen to this address)

NFTs present at outputs of this contract:
- staking/staking_vote_nft (authenticates a valid participation in the tally towards the tally contract)
- staking/vault_ft (represents locked governance tokens)
- staking/vote_permission_nft (permits a third party to execute an addition or retraction of tally participation, i.e. votes)
- tally/tally_auth_nft (1 at the output that goes to the tally and has previously been at the tally)

It is not allowed to spend several staking states in a single transaction.
