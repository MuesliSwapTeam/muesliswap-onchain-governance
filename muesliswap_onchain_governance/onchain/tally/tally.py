"""
The tally contract.

This contract holds the current state of a tally. It interacts with the staking contract in order to add and retract
its participation in the tally.

This contract is intended to be have inputs from these contracts:
- tally/tally: Maintaining the state of the tally votes
- staking/staking: For tracking the addition or retraction of votes

This contract is intended to have mints with these contracts:
- staking/staking_vote_nft: For tracking the addition (resp. retraction) of participation in a tally by mint (resp. burn)

Outputs of this contract may go to:
- tally/tally (1 at most, continuation of the above)
- staking/staking (1 at most, maintaining the state of participations, no value transfer should happen here)

Relevant NFTs present at outputs of this contract:
- staking/staking_vote_nft (authenticates a valid participation in the tally towards the tally contract)
- staking/vault_ft (represents locked governance tokens)
- tally/tally_auth_nft (1 at the output that goes to the tally and has previously been at the tally)

It is not allowed to spend several tally states in a single transaction.
